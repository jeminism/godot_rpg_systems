v0.0.1 20250413
---------------
* Reworked skill system. 
	* Skills must be triggered by entities. Created new entity of type Effector to support this.
	* Skills of different types can be called be generic triggers in the base class, but can be overridden by child specialization
	* All harmful objects, AOE / Projectiles, should be of EffectorEntity type. These effectors will then trigger skills on other entities
	* Complex skills are then a combination of effects which spawn new entities which then trigger subsequent effects.
* Refactored spawning skill implementation to be more generic
* Auto attack skill added, can be used to automatically target and fire a projectile at a signle entity in the area.
